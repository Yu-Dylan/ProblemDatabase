Three opaque cups are placed upside down on a table and a ball is placed underneath the middle one. A \emph{flip} consists of randomly choosing one of the outside cups and swapping it with the middle cup (moving the ball along with the cup if the ball is underneath either cup). A magician performs $2017$ flips. What is the probability that the middle cup contains the ball?
