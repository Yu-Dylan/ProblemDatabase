Let $Z_1Z_2Z_3$ be a triangle with inellipse $\mathcal{E}$ which is tangent to $Z_{i+1}Z_{i+2}$ at $Y_i$ (indices taken modulo $3$).
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item There exist positive real constants $k_1,k_2,k_3$ such that $\frac{Z_{i+1}Y_i}{Y_iZ_{i+2}}=\frac{k_{i+1}}{k_{i+2}}$.
	\item If we put the triangle and ellipse on the complex plane with number $z_i$ corresponding to point $Z_i$ and define the function \[P\left(z\right)=\left(z-z_1\right)^{k_1}\left(z-z_2\right)^{k_2}\left(z-z_3\right)^{k_3},\] then there are two roots of $P'$ that are not roots of $P$, and they are the foci of $\mathcal{E}$.
\end{enumerate}
