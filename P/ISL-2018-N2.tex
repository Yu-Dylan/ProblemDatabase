Let $n>1$ be a positive integer. Each cell of an $n\times n$ table contains an integer. Suppose that the following conditions are satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item Each number in the table is congruent to $1$ modulo $n$;
	\item The sum of numbers in any row, as well as the sum of numbers in any column, is congruent to $n$ modulo $n^2$.
\end{enumerate}
Let $R_i$ be the product of the numbers in the $i$th row, and $C_j$ be the product of the numbers in the $j$th column. Prove that the sums $R_1+\cdots+R_n$ and $C_1+\cdots+C_n$ are congruent modulo $n^4$.
