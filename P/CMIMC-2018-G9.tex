Suppose $\mathcal{E}_1\neq\mathcal{E}_2$ are two intersecting ellipses with a common focus $X$; let the common external tangents of $\mathcal{E}_1$ and $\mathcal{E}_2$ intersect at a point $Y$. Further suppose that $X_1$ and $X_2$ are the other foci of $\mathcal{E}_1$ and $\mathcal{E}_2$, respectively, such that $X_1\in\mathcal{E}_2$ and $X_2\in\mathcal{E}_1$. If $X_1X_2=8$, $XX_2=7$, and $XX_1=9$, what is $XY^2$?
