Let $n\geq2$ be a positive integer. There are $2n$ people standing equally spaced around a circle. Each person knows exactly $3$ of the other $2n-1$ people: the $2$ people standing next to her or him, as well as the person directly across the circle. How many ways are there for the $2n$ people to split into $n$ pairs so that the members of each pair know each other?
