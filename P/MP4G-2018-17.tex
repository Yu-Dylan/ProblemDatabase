Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB=5$, $BC=4$, and $CA=3$. On each side of $ABC$, externally erect a semicircle whose diameter is the corresponding side. Let $X$ be on the semicircular arc erected on side $\overline{BC}$ such that $\angle{CBX}$ has measure $15^\circ$. Let $Y$ be on the semicircular arc erected on side $\overline{CA}$ such that $\angle{ACY}$ has measure $15^\circ$. Similarly, let $Z$ be on the semicircular arc erected on side $\overline{AB}$ such that $\angle{BAX}$ has measure $15^\circ$. What is the area of triangle $XYZ$? Express your answer as a fraction in simplest form.
