Every positive integer is either \emph{nice} or \emph{naughty}, and the Oracle of Numbers knows which are which. However, the Oracle will not directly tell you whether a number is nice or naughty. The only questions the Oracle will answer are questions of the form ``What is the sum of all nice divisors of $n$?,'' where $n$ is a number of the questioner's choice. For instance, suppose (\emph{just} for this example) that $2$ and $3$ are nice, while $1$ and $6$ are naughty. In that case, if you asked the Oracle, ``What is the sum of all nice divisors of $6$?,'' the Oracle's answer would be $5$.

Show that for any given positive integer $n$ less than $1$ million, you can determine whether $n$ is nice or naughty by asking the Oracle at most four questions.
