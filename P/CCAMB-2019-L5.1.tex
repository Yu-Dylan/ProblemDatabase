Let $F_1=F_2=1$ and $F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$ for any integer $n\geq3$. For some integer $k>1$, Johnny converts $F_k$ kilometers to miles, then rounds to the nearest integer. Assume that $1$ mile is exactly $1.609344$ kilometers. Estimate the smallest value of $k$ such that Johnny \emph{does not} get that this is $F_{k-1}$ miles. An estimate of $E$ earns $2^{1-\left|A-E\right|}$ points, where $A$ is the actual answer.
