$64$ teams with distinct skill levels participate in a knockout tournament. In each of the $6$ rounds, teams are paired into match-ups and compete; the winning team moves on to the next round and the losing team is eliminated. After the second-to-last round, winners compete for first and second and losers compete for third and fourth. Assume that the team with higher skill level always wins. What is the probability that the first, second, and third place teams have the highest, second highest, and third highest skill levels, respectively?
