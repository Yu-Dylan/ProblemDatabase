How many permutations of $\left\{1,2,\ldots,8\right\}$ have a number of \emph{inversions} that is a multiple of $5$?
	
	Note: An \emph{inversion} in a permutation $\pi$ of $\left\{1,2,\ldots,8\right\}$ is a pair $\left(i,j\right)$ such that $i<j$ but $\pi\left(i\right)>\pi\left(j\right)$. For example, the permutation $\pi\left(i\right)=i$ has no inversions and the permutation $\pi\left(i\right)=9-i$ has $28$ inversions.
