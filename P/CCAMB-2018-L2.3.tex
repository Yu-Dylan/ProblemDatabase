On January $20$, $2018$, Sally notices that her $7$ children have ages which sum to a perfect square: their ages are $1$, $3$, $5$, $7$, $9$, $11$, and $13$, with $1+3+5+7+9+11+13=49$. Let $N$ be the age of the youngest child the next year the sum of the $7$ children's ages is a perfect square on January $20$th, and let $P$ be that perfect square. Find $N+P$.
