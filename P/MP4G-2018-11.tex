Maryam has a fair tetrahedral die, with the four faces of the die labeled $1$ through $4$. At each step, she rolls the die and records which number is on the bottom face. She stops when the current number is greater than or equal to the previous number. (In particular, she takes at least two steps.) What is the expected number (average number) of steps that she takes? Express your answer as a fraction in simplest form.
