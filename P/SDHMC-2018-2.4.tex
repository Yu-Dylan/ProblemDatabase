Define the Collatz sequence starting with a number $m$ to be the sequence of integers defined by $a_1=m$ and for $n\geq1$, \[a_{n+1}=
\begin{cases}
	\frac{a_n}{2} & \text{if $a_n$ is even} \\
	3a_n+1 & \text{if $a_n$ is odd}
\end{cases}
\] Prove that there are integers $n,m$ with $2^n>m>0$ so that the Collatz sequence starting from $m$ contains terms larger than $3^{n+2018}$.
