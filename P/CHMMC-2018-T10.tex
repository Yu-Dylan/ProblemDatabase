Let $ABC$ be a triangle such that $AB=13$, $BC=14$, $AC=15$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$ and define $P\neq B$ to be a point on the circumcircle of $ABC$ such that $BP\perp PM$. Furthermore, let $H$ be the orthocenter of $ABM$ and define $Q$ to be the intersection of $BP$ and $AC$. If $R$ is a point on $HQ$ such that $RB\perp BC$, find the length of $RB$.
