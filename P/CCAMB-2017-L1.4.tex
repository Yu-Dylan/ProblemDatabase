Wild Bill goes to Las Vejas and takes part in a special lottery called [i]Reverse Yrettol[/i]. In this lottery, a player may buy a ticket on which he or she may select $5$ distinct numbers from $1-20$ (inclusive). Then, $5$ distinct numbers from $1-20$ are drawn at random. A player wins if his or her ticket contains [i]none[/i] of the numbers which were drawn. If Wild Bill buys a ticket, what is the probability that he will win?
