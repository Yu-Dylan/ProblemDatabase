To begin a game of Hearts, $13$ cards are dealt from a standard $52$-card deck to each of four players. Each player then chooses exactly $3$ cards to pass to the person to the left. Then, each person takes the cards passed from the person to the right and adds them to the hand. Suppose that Nicky is playing in a game of Hearts with three other people who randomly choose which cards to pass. Given that Nicky wants to have his hand be all hearts (there are $13$ hearts in a deck) after the passing and he passes optimally for this objective, let $P$ be the probability that Nicky indeed has all hearts in his hand at the end. Determine the numerator of $P$ when $P$ is written in simplest form.
