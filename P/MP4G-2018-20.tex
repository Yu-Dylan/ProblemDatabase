A \emph{smooth number} is a positive integer of the form $2^m3^n$, where $m$ and $n$ are nonnegative integers. Let $S$ be the set of all triples $\left(a,b,c\right)$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are smooth numbers such that $\gcd\left(a,b\right)$, $\gcd\left(b,c\right)$, and $\gcd\left(c,a\right)$ are all distinct. Evaluate the infinite sum $\sum_{\left(a,b,c\right)\in S}\frac{1}{abc}$. Express your answer as a fraction in simplest form. Recall that $\gcd\left(x,y\right)$ is the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $y$.
