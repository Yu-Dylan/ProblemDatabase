Circle $\omega$ is tangent to sides $AB,AC$ of triangle $ABC$ at $D,E$ respectively, such that $D\neq B$, $E\neq C$, and $BD+CE<BC$. $F,G$ lie on $BC$ such that $BF=BD,CG=CE$. Let $DG$ and $EF$ meet at $K$. $L$ lies on minor arc $DE$ of $\omega$ such that the tangent at $L$ to $\omega$ is parallel to $BC$. Prove that the incenter of $\triangle{ABC}$ lies on $KL$.
