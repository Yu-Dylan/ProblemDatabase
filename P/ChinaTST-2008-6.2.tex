Prove that for all $n\geq2$, there exists a polynomial $f(x)=x^n+a_1x^{n-1}+\ldots+a_n$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
	\item $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ are all non-zero;
	\item $f(x)$ cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients;
	\item For any integer $x$, $|f(x)|$ is not prime.
\end{enumerate}
