Let $p\geq2$ be a prime number. Eduardo and Fernando play the following game making moves alternately: in each move, the current player chooses an index $i$ in the set $\left\{1,2,\ldots,p-1\right\}$ that was not chosen before by either of the two players and then chooses an element $a_i$ of the set $\left\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\right\}$. Eduardo has the first move. The game ends after all the indices $i\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,p-1\right\}$ have been chosen. Then the following number is computed: \[M=a_0+10\cdot a_1+10^2\cdot a_2+\cdots+10^{p-1}a_{p-1}=\displaystyle\sum_{j=0}^{p-1}a_j\cdot10^j.\] The goal of Eduardo is to make the number $M$ divisible by $p$, and the goal of Fernando is to prevent this. 

Prove that Eduardo has a winning strategy.
