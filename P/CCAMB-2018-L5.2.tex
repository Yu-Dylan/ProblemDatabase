Two circles of equal radii are drawn to intersect at $X$ and $Y$. Suppose that the two circles bisect each other's areas. If the measure of minor arc $\widehat{XY}$ is $\theta$ degrees, estimate $\left\lfloor1000\theta\right\rfloor$.

An estimate of $E$ earns $2e^{-\frac{\left|A-E\right|}{50000}}$ points, where $A$ is the actual answer.
