Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle and $M,N$ be the midpoints of minor arcs $CA,AB$ of the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$. Point $D$ is the midpoint of segment $MN$ and point $G$ lies on minor arc $BC$. Denote by $I,I_1,I_2$ the incenters of triangles $ABC,ABG,ACG$ respectively. Let $P$ be the second intersection of the circumcircle of triangle $GI_1I_2$ with the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$. Prove that $D,I,P$ are collinear.
