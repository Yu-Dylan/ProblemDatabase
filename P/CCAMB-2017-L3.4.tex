A random walk is a process in which something moves from point to point, and where the direction of movement at each step is randomly chosen. Suppose that a person conducts a random walk on a line: he starts at $0$ and each minute randomly moves either $1$ unit in the positive direction or $1$ unit in the negative direction. What is his expected distance from the origin after $6$ moves?
