Choose an integer $n$ from $1$ to $10$ inclusive as your answer to this problem. Let $m$ be the number of distinct values in $\left\{1,2,\ldots,10\right\}$ chosen by all teams at the Math Bonanza for this problem which are greater than or equal to $n$. Your score on this problem will be $\frac{mn}{15}$. For example, if $5$ teams choose $1$, $2$ teams choose $2$, and $6$ teams choose $3$ with these being the only values chosen, and you choose $2$, you will receive $\frac{4}{15}$ points.
