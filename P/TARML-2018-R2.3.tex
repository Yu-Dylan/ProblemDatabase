Let $T=TNYWR$. Kelvin the Frog jumps along the coordinate line landing at integer points. It starts from a uniformly randomly selected integer between $0$ and $999$, inclusive. Its first jump has length $3$ and is to the left, the second one has length $5$ and is to the right, the third one has length $9$ and is to the left, and so on (the $k$th jump has length $2^k+1$ and is to the left if $k$ is odd and to the right if $k$ is even). Compute the expected number of jumps required before Kelvin crosses $T$ with a jump. Landing on $T$ does not count as crossing it.
