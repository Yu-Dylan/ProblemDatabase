A set $P$ of subsets of $\mathbb{Z}$ is called a \emph{partition} of $\mathbb{Z}$ if the empty set is not in $P$, every integer is in some element of $P$, and no two elements of $P$ have a common element. A partition $P$ is called \emph{compatible} if for all elements $A,B$ in $P$, there exists an element $C$ of $P$ that contains every integer which can be expressed in the form $a+b$ for some $a$ in $A$ and $b$ in $B$. Find all compatible partitions of $\mathbb{Z}$.
