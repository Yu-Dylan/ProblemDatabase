The first question was asked in Set 4. The second question was asked in Set 5.

Question) Eshaan the Elephant has a long memory. He remembers that out of the integers $0, 1, 2, \dots, 15$, one of them is special. Submit to the grader an ordered 4-tuple of subsets of $0, 1, 2, \dots, 15$ and they will tell you whether the special number is in each. You can then submit your guess for the special number on the next round for points. (You might want to write down a copy of your submission somewhere other than your answer sheet. Note that this question itself is not worth any points, though the corresponding problem in Set 5 is.)

    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
        1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline
        Y/N & Y/N & Y/N & Y/N \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    What is the special number?
