Suppose that $\omega$ and $\omega_A$ are the incircle and $A$-excircle of $\triangle{ABC}$ with $AB=13,BC=14,CA=15$ such that $\omega$ and $\omega_A$ touch $BC$ at $D$ and $E$, respectively. If $\gamma$ is the circle passing through the midpoints of the sides of $\triangle{ABC}$, let $P$ be a point such that $PD$, $\omega$, and $\gamma$ are concurrent and $PE$, $\omega_A$, and $\gamma$ are concurrent. What is the minimum possible distance from $P$ to $BC$?
