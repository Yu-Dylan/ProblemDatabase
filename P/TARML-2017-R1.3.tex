Let $T=\text{TNYWR}$ and $K=T+5$. For a positive integer $a$, let $S\left(a\right)$ be the sum of the first $a$ positive integers and $T\left(a\right)$ be the sum of the reciprocals of $S\left(i\right)$ for $i=1,2,\ldots,a$. At a recent math contest, Nicky was asked to compute $\left\lfloor5T\left(M\right)\right\rfloor$ for some positive integer $M$. However, his paper was printed poorly, so he could not tell what $M$ was. He guessed that $M=K$ and surprisingly got the question right! Assuming that he did all calculations correctly, what is the sum of all possible values of $M$ that could have been used on the contest?
