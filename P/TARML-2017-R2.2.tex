Let $T=\text{TNYWR}$. Two circles $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ centered at $A$ and $B$ intersect at $X$ and $Y$. The radius of $\mathcal{C}_2$ is $3$, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $T$, and the lines tangent to $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ at $X$ are perpendicular to each other. Given that a line through $A$ intersects $\mathcal{C}_2$ at distinct points $P$ and $Q$ such that $AP=\sqrt{2}$, compute $AQ$.
