Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle. $PQRS$ is a rectangle with $P$ on $AB$, $Q$ and $R$ on $BC$, and $S$ on $AC$ such that $PQRS$ has the largest area among all rectangles $TUVW$ with $T$ on $AB$, $U$ and $V$ on $BC$, and $W$ on $AC$. If $D$ is the point on $BC$ such that $AD\perp BC$, then $PQ$ is the harmonic mean of $\frac{AD}{DB}$ and $\frac{AD}{DC}$. What is $BC$?

Note: The harmonic mean of two numbers $a$ and $b$ is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of $a$ and $b$.
