Suppose that a planet contains $\left(CCAMATHBONANZA_{71}\right)^{100}$ people ($100$ in decimal), where in base $71$ the digits $A,B,C,\ldots,Z$ represent the decimal numbers $10,11,12,\ldots,35$, respectively. Suppose that one person on this planet is snapping, and each time they snap, at least half of the current population disappears. Estimate the largest number of times that this person can snap without disappearing. An estimate of $E$ earns $2^{1-\frac{1}{200}\left|A-E\right|}$ points, where $A$ is the actual answer.
