Alex is walking around a regular pentagon, starting at one of the vertices. At every second, she randomly chooses (with equal probability) to go to either of the neighboring vertices. What is the expected amount of time, in seconds, that it will take for Alex to complete a \emph{cycle}?
	
	Note: A \emph{cycle} starts at one vertex and takes $5$ seconds to go around the pentagon following the same direction each step --- no backtracking. For example, if Alex goes counterclockwise $5$ times to start, then this is a cycle, but if she goes counterclockwise $4$ times, clockwise $2$ times, then counterclockwise $3$ times, this is not a cycle.
