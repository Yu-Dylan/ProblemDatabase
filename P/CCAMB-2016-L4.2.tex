Consider the $2\times3$ rectangle below. We fill in the small squares with the numbers $1,2,3,4,5,6$ (one per square). Define a \emph{tasty} filling to be one such that each row is \textbf{not} in numerical order from left to right and each column is \textbf{not} in numerical order from top to bottom. If the probability that a randomly selected filling is tasty is $\frac{m}{n}$ for relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$, what is $m+n$?
