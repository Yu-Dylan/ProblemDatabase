Bela and Jenn play the following game on the closed interval $[0, n]$ of the real number line, where $n$ is a fixed integer greater than $4$. They take turns playing, with Bela going first. At his first turn, Bela chooses any real number in the interval $[0, n]$. Thereafter, the player whose turn it is chooses a real number that is more than one unit away from all numbers previously chosen by either player. A player unable to choose such a number loses. Using optimal strategy, which player will win the game?

$\textbf{(A) } \text{Bela will always win.}$
$\textbf{(B) } \text{Jenn will always win.} $
$\textbf{(C) } \text{Bela will win if and only if }n \text{ is odd.}$
$\textbf{(D) } \text{Jenn will win if and only if }n \text{ is odd.} $
$\textbf{(E) } \text{Jenn will win if and only if }n > 8.$
