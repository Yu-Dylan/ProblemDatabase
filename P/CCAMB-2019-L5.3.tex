For a positive integer $n$, let $d\left(n\right)$ be the number of positive divisors of $n$ (for example $d\left(39\right)=4$). Estimate the average value that $d\left(n\right)$ takes on as $n$ ranges from $1$ to $2019$. An estimate of $E$ earns $2^{1-\left|A-E\right|}$ points, where $A$ is the actual answer.
