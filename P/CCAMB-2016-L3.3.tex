Triangle $ABC$ has side length $AB = 5$, $BC = 12$, and $CA = 13$. Circle $\Gamma$ is centered at point $X$ exterior to triangle $ABC$ and passes through points $A$ and $C$. Let $D$ be the second intersection of $\Gamma$ with segment $\overline{BC}$. If $\angle BDA = \angle CAB$, the radius of $\Gamma$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$ for relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$. Compute $m+n$.
