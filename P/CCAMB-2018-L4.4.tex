Alice and Billy are playing a game on a number line. They both start at $0$. Each turn, Alice has a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance of moving $1$ unit in the positive direction, and a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance of moving $1$ unit in the negative direction, while Billy has a $\frac{2}{3}$ chance of moving $1$ unit in the positive direction, and a $\frac{1}{3}$ chance of moving $1$ unit in the negative direction. Alice and Billy alternate turns, with Alice going first. If a player reaches $2$, they win and the game ends, but if they reach $-2$, they lose and the other player wins, and the game ends. What is the probability that Billy wins?
