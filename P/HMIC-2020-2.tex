Some bishops and knights are placed on an infinite chessboard, where each square has side length $1$ unit. Suppose that the following conditions hold:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For each bishop, there exists a knight on the same diagonal as that bishop (there may be another piece between the bishop and the knight).
	\item For each knight, there exists a bishop that is exactly $\sqrt{5}$ units away from it.
	\item If any piece is removed from the board, then at least one of the above conditions is no longer satisfied.
\end{itemize}
If $n$ is the total number of pieces on the board, find all possible values of $n$.
