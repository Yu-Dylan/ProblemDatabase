Noew is writing a $15$-problem mock AIME consisting of four subjects of problems: algebra, geometry, combinatorics, and number theory. The AIME is considered \emph{somewhat evenly distributed} if there is at least one problem of each subject and there are at least six combinatorics problems. Two AIMEs are considered \emph{similar} if they have the same subject distribution (same number of each subject). How many non-similar somewhat evenly distributed mock AIMEs can Noew write?
