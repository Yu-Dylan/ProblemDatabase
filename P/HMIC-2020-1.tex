Sir Alex is coaching a soccer team of $n$ players of distinct heights. He wants to line them up so that for each player $P$, the total number of players that are either to the left of $P$ and taller than $P$ or to the right of $P$ and shorter than $P$ is even. In terms of $n$, how many possible orders are there?
