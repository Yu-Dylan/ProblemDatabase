Let $P_1P_2P_3P_4$ be a tetrahedron in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and let $O$ be a point equidistant from each of its vertices. Suppose there exists a point $H$ such that for each $i$,  the line $P_iH$ is perpendicular to the plane through the other three vertices. Line $P_1H$ intersects the plane through $P_2, P_3, P_4$ at $A$, and contains a point $B\neq P_1$ such that $OP_1=OB$. Show that $HB=3HA$.
