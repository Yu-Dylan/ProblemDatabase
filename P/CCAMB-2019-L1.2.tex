At Kanye Crest Academy, employees get paid in CCA Math Bananas\textsuperscript{TM}. At the end of $2018$, Professor Shian Bray was given a $10\%$ pay raise from his salary at the end of $2017$. However, inflation caused the worth of a CCA Math Banana\textsuperscript{TM} to decrease by $1\%$. If Prof. Bray's salary at the end of $2017$ was worth one million dollars, how much (in dollars) was Prof. Bray's salary worth at the end of $2018$? Assume that the value of the dollar has not changed.
