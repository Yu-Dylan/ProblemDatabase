How many integers $n \geq 2$ are there such that whenever $z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n$ are complex numbers such that $$|z_1| = |z_2| = \dots = |z_n| = 1\quad\text{and}\quad z_1 + z_2 + \dots + z_n = 0,$$ then the numbers $z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n$ are equally spaced on the unit circle in the complex plane?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 2 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 3 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 4 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 5$
