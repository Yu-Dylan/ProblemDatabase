The Garfield Super Winners play $100$ games of foosball, in which teams score a non-negative integer number of points and the team with more points after ten minutes wins (if both teams have the same number of points, it is a draw). Suppose that the Garfield Super Winners score an average of $7$ points per game but allow an average of $8$ points per game. Given that the Garfield Super Winners never won or lost by more than $10$, what is the largest possible number of games that they could win?
