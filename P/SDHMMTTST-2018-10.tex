Alice and Bilbo play a game on an infinite piece of paper. Alice draws a \emph{country}, which is the union of finitely many bounded polygons (possibly with polygonal holes) on the paper. Bilbo then assigns a color to this newly drawn country. This process repeats indefinitely, with Alice drawing new countries which share no interior points with any previous country and Bilbo assigning colors. If Bilbo colors in a way such that no two countries whose intersection contains a line segment have the same color, prove that Alice can force Bilbo to use an arbitrarily large number of colors.
