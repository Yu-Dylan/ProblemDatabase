Note that $2^8\equiv-1\pmod{257}$, so $2^{16}\equiv1\pmod{257}$. Since $n!\equiv0\pmod{16}$ for $n\geq6$, we get that \[2^{n!}+1\equiv2\pmod{257},\] so the only possible $n$ are $n\leq5$. We can verify that $n=4$ and $5$ work because in these cases, $n!\equiv8\pmod{16}$, so \[2^{n!}+1\equiv2^8+1\equiv0\pmod{256}.\] Furthermore, $n=1,2,3$ fail because $0<2^{n!}+1<257$. Thus, the only numbers that work are $4$ and $5$, so the sum is $\boxed{9}$.
