I claim that for any positive integer $n$, Alice can force Bilbo to use $n$ colors, each of which touches the \emph{neutral zone} (the infinite region with no country) in some country. We can prove this by induction on $n$. The base case of $n=1$ is trivial (Alice takes a rectangle at the start). We now prove that if we have a construction for $n$, we can find one for $n+1$.

Duplicate the construction for $n$ and put the copy very far away from the original. We can assume that the same colors are used in the same order (up to permutation) in the copy, otherwise either there is a border with the same color or an $\left(n+1\right)$th color is used (in which case we are done). Take a rectangle which contains the copy in its interior. We can assume that the rectangle does not touch the original construction for $n$. Then Alice can draw the region inside the rectangle but outside the copy as the next country which must be coloured by an $\left(n+1\right)$th colour as this region touches all of the original $n$ colors. Then we have found a construction with $n+1$ colors, each of which touches the neutral zone. Thus, the inductive step is proven and we deduce that our claim is true.

But this claim immediately implies that Alice can force Bilbo to use an arbitrarily large number of colors.
