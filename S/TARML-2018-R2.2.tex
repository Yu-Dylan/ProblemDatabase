Suppose that the line passing through these three points is $y=Mx+B$ for some constants $M$ and $B$. Then the intersection points have $x$ coordinates which are solutions to \[2Tx^3+2018Tx^2+x-T^2=Mx+B.\] By Vieta's Formula, the sum of the $x$ coordinates is $-1009$. So then $r=-1009-20-17=\boxed{-1046}$.
