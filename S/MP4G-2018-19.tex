A reasonable estimate is $\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{\sqrt{2k-1}}\approx\displaystyle\int_0^n\frac{dx}{\sqrt{2x}}=\sqrt{2n}$, obtained by the midpoint rule on this integral with intervals of the form $\left[m,m+1\right]$ for $m=0,1,\ldots,n-1$. This would give the approximation $\sqrt{9802}=99+\eps$. A better estimate, motivated by the fact that there is a huge amount of excess on the interval $\left[0,1\right]$, would be $1+\displaystyle\int_1^n\frac{dx}{\sqrt{2x}}=\sqrt{2n}-\sqrt{2}+1\approx98.586$. One could go even further, directly computing more terms and reducing the amount we estimate in the integral, but it becomes obvious that the estimate converges towards a value between $98.57$ and $98.59$. Either way, the floor of the sum is $\boxed{98}$.

To rigorize this, estimate the error of the integral in the interval $\left[m,m+1\right]$ for $m=1,2,\ldots,n-1$. The integral gives an estimate of $\displaystyle\int_m^{m+1}\frac{dx}{\sqrt{2x}}=\sqrt{2}\left(\sqrt{m+1}-\sqrt{m}\right)=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{m+1}+\sqrt{m}}$ while the actual value is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2m+1}}$, so the error is \[\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{m+1}+\sqrt{m}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2m+1}}=\frac{\sqrt{4m+2}-\sqrt{m+1}-\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{2m+1}\left(\sqrt{m+1}+\sqrt{m}\right)}<\frac{\sqrt{6}-\sqrt{2}-1}{2\sqrt{2}m},\] where we use the fact that the function $\sqrt{4x+2}-\sqrt{x+1}-\sqrt{x}$ is decreasing on the positive reals. Then the total error is at most \[\displaystyle\sum_{m=1}^{n-1}\frac{\sqrt{6}-\sqrt{2}-1}{2\sqrt{2}m}=\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}\right)H_{n-1}<\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}\right)\left(\log\left(n-1\right)+1\right)<0.13\] and hence the value of the sum is between $\sqrt{9802}-\sqrt{2}+1-0.13>98$ and $\sqrt{9802}-\sqrt{2}+1<99$, so the floor is $98$ as desired.
