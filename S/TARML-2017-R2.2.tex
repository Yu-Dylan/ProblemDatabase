Note that the perpendicularity implies that $AX$ and $BX$ are perpendicular. Then \[AX^2+BX^2=AB^2,\] so \[AX^2=AB^2-BX^2=T^2-9.\] Since $AX$ is a tangent to $\Gamma_2$, Power of a Point gives us that \[AX^2=AP\cdot AQ.\] Thus, \[AQ=\frac{AX^2}{AP}=\frac{T^2-9}{\sqrt{2}}.\] Since $T=4$, we get that $AQ=\boxed{\frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}}$.

Note: The problem does not actually require that $AX$ and $BX$ are perpendicular. We can do the above algebra replacing $X$ with a point $P'$ on $\mathcal{C}_2$ such that $AP'$ is tangent to $\mathcal{C}_2$ and we would get the same answer.
