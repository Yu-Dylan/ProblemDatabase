Let $p$ be the probability that the coin flips M. Then the probability that the coin flips H,T is $\frac{1}{2}\left(1-p\right)$. Then the probability that the coin flips HMMTT is \[\frac{1}{8}\left(1-p\right)^3p^2\leq\frac{1}{8}\cdot\frac{4}{9}\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^5=\boxed{\frac{27}{6250}}\] by AM-GM on $1-p$ three times and $\frac{3}{2}p$ twice.
