The number of ways to choose three distinct numbers is $\binom{20}{3}$. To choose an arithmetic progression, we need the first and last numbers to have the same parity (and this is sufficient). There are $\binom{10}{2}$ ways if these are odd and $\binom{10}{2}$ ways if these are even for $2\binom{10}{2}$ total arithmetic progressions. Thus, the probability of rolling an arithmetic progression is $\frac{2\binom{10}{2}}{\binom{20}{3}}=\boxed{\frac{3}{38}}$.
