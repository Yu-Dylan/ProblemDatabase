Consider the polynomial $f(x)=x^n+210(x^{n-1}+\ldots+x^2)+105x+5$. This is constructed so that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $f$ only outputs even numbers
	\item $f$ is irreducible by Eisenstein on $p=5$
	\item $f-2$ is irreducible by Eisenstein on $p=3$
	\item $f+2$ is irreducible by Eisenstein on $p=7$
\end{itemize}
Thus $|f(x)|$ is an even integer but not $2$ and is thus composite.
