Let $P\left(x\right)=x^5-x-42$. Suppose that $P\left(n\right)\equiv0\pmod{49}$. Then $P\left(n\right)\equiv0\pmod7$, so $n\left(n+1\right)\left(n-1\right)\left(n^2+1\right)$ is divisible by $7$. Then $n\equiv0,\pm1\pmod7$. Let $r\in\left\{0,\pm1\right\}$, so $n-r$ is divisible by $7$. Now, by Taylor Series, \[0\equiv P\left(n\right)\equiv P\left(r\right)+P'\left(r\right)\left(n-r\right)\pmod{49}.\] This is because $P^{\left(k\right)}\left(r\right)$ is divisible by $k!$ for each $k$ (to prove this, separate into monomials and use binomial coefficients) and $\left(n-r\right)^k$ is divisible by $49$ for $k\geq2$. With $P'\left(x\right)=5x^4-1$, we can plug in the values of $r$ and solve for $n$ to get that $n\equiv7,36,34\pmod{49}$ (corresponding to $r=0,1,-1$ respectively). So the possible values of $n$ are $\boxed{7,34,36}$.
