After $2n-1$ jumps for a positive integer $n$, Kelvin has jumped \[\left(2+1\right)-\left(4+1\right)+\left(8+1\right)-\ldots+\left(2^{2n-1}+1\right)=\frac{2^{2n}+5}{3}\] units to the left. When the starting point is greater than $\frac{2^{10}+5}{3}=343$ but less than $\frac{2^{12}+5}{3}=1367$, it takes $11$ jumps. This happens when the starting point is between $0$ and $1367-1046-1=320$, inclusive. The next threshold is at $\frac{2^{14}+5}{3}-1046>1000$, so the remaining $1000-321=678$ starting points require $13$ jumps. So the expected number of jumps is $\frac{321\cdot11+679\cdot13}{1000}=\boxed{12.358}$.
