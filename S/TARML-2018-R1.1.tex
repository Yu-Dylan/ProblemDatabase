We need $\left(\frac{n\left(n+1\right)}{2}\right)^2$ to be divisible by $4$, so $\frac{n\left(n+1\right)}{2}$ is divisible by $2$. Then $n\left(n+1\right)$ is divisible by $4$, so $n$ or $n+1$ is divisible by $4$. Among the elements of $\left\{4k-3,4k-2,4k-1,4k\right\}$, only $4k-1$ and $4k$ work. So clearly the $2018$th smallest positive integer which works is $4\cdot1009=\boxed{4036}$.
