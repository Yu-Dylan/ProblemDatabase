By Feuerbach, $\omega,\gamma$ are tangent at $D'$ and $\omega_A,\gamma$ are tangent at $E'$, so $P$ is the intersection of $DD'$ and $EE'$. Clearly $D'$ is inside $\triangle{ABC}$ and $E'$ is outside $\triangle{ABC}$. Let $P'$ be the point on $\gamma$ such that the tangent to $\gamma$ at $P'$ is parallel to $BC$ and $P'$ is on the opposite side of $BC$ as $A$ ($P'$ is the midpoint of minor arc $MX$ of $\gamma$, where $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$ and $X$ is the foot of the $A$-altitude). The homothety sending $\omega$ to $\gamma$ (centered at $D'$) must send $D$ to $P'$. Similarly, the negative homothety sending $\omega_A$ to $\gamma$ (centered at $E'$) must send $E$ to $P'$. Thus, $P=P'$ and $P$ is the midpoint of minor arc $MX$. Observe that the radius of $\gamma$ is $\frac{R}{2}=\frac{65}{16}$, where $R$ is the circumradius of $\triangle{ABC}$. Since $BM=7$ and $BX=5$, we have that $MX=2$. Then the distance from the center of $\gamma$ to $MX$ is $\sqrt{\left(\frac{65}{16}\right)^2-1^2}=\frac{63}{16}$, so the distance from $P$ to $MX$ is $\frac{65}{16}-\frac{63}{16}=\boxed{\frac{1}{8}}$.
