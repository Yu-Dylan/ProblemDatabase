Note that Nicky needs to start with $10$ hearts and $3$ of other cards. There are $\binom{13}{10}\binom{39}{3}$ ways to choose these cards. Then the probability that this hand is drawn by Nicky is $\frac{1}{\binom{52}{13}}$. Now, the person to the right of Nicky needs to have $3$ hearts and $10$ of other cards. There are $\binom{36}{10}$ ways to choose these cards (the hearts are already predetermined). The probability that this hand is drawn is $\frac{1}{\binom{39}{13}}$. Now, the probability that the three hearts are randomly selected out of the $13$ cards in this neighbor's hand is $\frac{1}{\binom{13}{3}}$. Putting these together, the probability that Nicky gets his wish is \[\frac{\binom{13}{10}\binom{39}{3}\binom{36}{10}}{\binom{52}{13}\binom{39}{13}\binom{13}{3}}=\frac{286}{\binom{52}{13}}.\] It can be verified that $\binom{52}{13}$ is even but not divisible by either $11$ or $13$, so the numerator is $\boxed{143}$.
