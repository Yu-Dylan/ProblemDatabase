Let $M$ be the Miquel point of complete quadrilateral $BFEC$. Then $(BFD)$ and $(CDE)$ meet at $M,D$, so $M$ and $D$ are reflections over $O_2O_3$. Thus you can reflect $M$ over the sides of $\triangle{O_1O_2O_3}$ to get $D,E,F\in\ell$, so by homothety the feet of $M$ on the sides of $\triangle{O_1O_2O_3}$ are collinear. By Simson Line, this implies $M\in(O_1O_2O_3)$. It is well-known that the Simson Line of $M$ passes through the midpoint of $MH$, where $H$ is the orthocenter of $\triangle{O_1O_2O_3}$. By the homothety, this implies that $H\in\ell$ as desired.
