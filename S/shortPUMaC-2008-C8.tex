Since the SET deck is isomorphic to $\mathbb{F}_3^4$ with SETs being equivalent to $x+y+z=0$, we are looking for the number of invertible affine transformations from $\mathbb{F}_{3^4}$ to itself, which is $3^4\left(3^4-1\right)\left(3^4-3\right)\left(3^4-3^2\right)\left(3^4-3^3\right)=\boxed{1965150720}$ as desired.
