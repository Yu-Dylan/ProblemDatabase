The answer is when $\displaystyle\sum_{i=k}^nx_i>0$ for some $k\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$.

Rewrite $\sum a_ix_i$ as \[x_1(a_1+\ldots+a_n)+(x_2-x_1)(a_2+\ldots+a_n)+(x_3-x_2)(a_3+\ldots+a_n)+\cdots+(x_n-x_{n-1})a_n.\] Necessity is obvious from this.

Now for sufficiency, take $x_i=i$ for $i<k$ and $x_i=N+i$ for $i\geq k$, where $N$ is a variable positive integer. Then $\sum a_ix_i$ is linear in $N$ with coefficient $\displaystyle\sum_{i=k}^nx_i>0$, so we can choose $N$ large enough such that this is positive.
