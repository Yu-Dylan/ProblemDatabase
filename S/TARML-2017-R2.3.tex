Letting $x=0$, we get that \[0=a_0\] since $P_i$ has a factor of $x$ for $i\geq1$. Letting $x=1$, we get that \[1=a_0+a_1\] since $P_i$ has a factor of $x-1$ for $i\geq2$. Letting $x=2$, we get that \[2^K=a_0+2a_1+a_2\] since $P_i$ has a factor of $x-2$ for $i\geq3$. Solving this system, we get that \[a_2=2^K-2.\] Since $T=\frac{7\sqrt{2}}{2}=\frac{7}{\sqrt{2}}$, we can note that $4<\frac{7}{\sqrt{2}}<5$ by multiplying out by $\sqrt{2}$ and squaring. Thus, $K=4$, so $a_2=2^4-2=\boxed{14}$.
