Note that $x^2+y^2=\left(x+y\right)^2$, so upon expanding, we discover that $xy=0$. That is, at least one of $x$ and $y$ are $0$. If both are $0$, there is $1$ solution. If only $x$ is $0$, there are $16$ solutions. Similarly, if only $y$ is $0$, there are $16$ solutions. Thus, there are a total of $1+16+16=\boxed{33}$ solutions.
