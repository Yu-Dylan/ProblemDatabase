First, smooth all entries of $A$ to either $-1$ or $1$ since $\det A$ is linear in each term. Consider $B=A^TA$ with eigenvalues $\lambda$. Since $b_{i,j}$ is the dot product of the $i$th and $j$th columns of $A$, the diagonal entries of $B$ are all $n$. Then \[\displaystyle\sum\lambda=\trace B=\underbrace{n+n+\ldots+n}_{n\text{ times}}=n^2.\] Now, observe that \[\det B=\displaystyle\prod\lambda\leq n^n\] by AM-GM, so \[\det A=\sqrt{\det B}\leq n^{\frac{n}{2}}.\]
